					<h2>Debugging</h2>
					<p>Experimenting with the debugger and break points using lab 13. I worked through the different breakpoints I made to see exactly when different vaiables or objects 
						got filled. Watching as 'undefined' changed to the input from the page really helped me understand how this would help if my code had a problem. You would be able
						to see if different variables weren't being fill or not and see exact how far your code was reading before breaking.
